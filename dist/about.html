										<h4>Eva Karamanovska</h4>
										<span>Head of Communications</span>
										<p>
											Hi, I am Eva Karamanovska, a fourth-year student in the Gymnasium Nikola Karev in Skopje. I am
											a young, very motivated individual with big ambitions and a great desire for work. I have been a
											member of student councils in both my primary and my high school, so the opportunity to be a
											part of the Union is an enormous opportunity both for personal development and for progress in
											education. I would call myself an artist that always uses her knowledge and talent for design to
											develop community projects. Ergo, my position in the Union is Head of Communications. I am a
											member of the graphic design team. I am also in charge of our social media profiles. I hope and
											believe that with lots of work and dedication, I will contribute to improving education in our
											country over these two years.

										<h4>Adora Limani</h4>
										<span>Head of Research and Strategy</span>
										<p>
											I am Adora Limani, and I attend NOVA International Schools. I am a fourth-year student. I have
											been a member of the Executive Board since 2020. Education activism and women&#39;s rights
											interest me particularly, so I founded the first feminist club in my school. My active
											participation in my school&#39;s debate club and newspaper, as well as my passion for writing,
											equipped me with research skills. That is why my current role in the Union is Head of Research and
											Strategy. My plan for the next two years is to use my skills and knowledge to help high-school
											students across the entire country fight for a better education.

										<h4>Emira Husovich</h4>
										<span>Advisor for International Curricula</span>
										<p>
											I am Emira Husovikj, the Advisor for International Curricula in the Union. Until September, 2022 I
											studied in the Gymnasium Koco Racin in Veles. However, last year I got a scholarship to study two
											years in one of the United World Colleges (UWC) in Tanzania. As an enthusiastic young student who
											wanted to make a change in the educational system, I joined the Union as an ambassador in the
											beginning of 2020. In 2022, I was appointed as the First - vice president of the Union. However,
											due to leaving Macedonia I became an Advisor for International Curricula. Beside being active in
											the Union, I have taken part in many NGOs like Ekvalis, Youth Can, Focus, Hera, Red Cross and
											UNICEF. Here in Tanzania, I am taking part in many committees in the school regarding
											sustainability, students’ rights, gender equality and anti-racism. I have been actively involved
											with the United Nations, as well as representing the students’ voice at the UN Pre-COP27 Youth
											Conference.
