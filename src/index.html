						<h3>Who are we?</h3>
						<p class="fst-italic">
							The Union of High-School Students of North Macedonia (Сојуз на
							средношколци на Република Северна Македонија – ССРСМ / Unioni i
							Nxënësve të Shkollave të Mesme – UNSHM) is the only nationwide
							representative body of high-school students in the country.
							The Union is a unique structure run by high schoolers for high schoolers, and therefore possesses a wealth
							of knowledge and information exclusive to the organization. Being the sole representative of Macedonian
							high school students, it has to be recognized as a group of education activists in the field of education.
							it should be a key player in the North Macedonia policy-making on educational and youth matters,
							representing the voice of secondary school students towards North Macedonia decision-making bodies,
							political institutions and other stakeholders in the field of education. The protection of school student
							rights must be ensured in North Macedonia and national policies on education. The organisation takes
							initiative of cooperation and dialogue between representative bodies for students, teachers, school
							principals and other institutions possessing political power. In this process, we play a key role in
							widening the well represented narrow perception of education. In our eyes, the matter of education can
							never be tackled without, in parallel, tackling society as a whole - education is not a static fragment of
							society, but a process constantly shaping society.

						<h3>Our history</h3>
						<p>
							Founded in November 2017 in Tetovo, we started as a non-profit, independent,
							nonpartisan student grassroots movement in the Polog region. The next three
							years marked the work of spreading the Union to the entirety of the country, as
							well as advocating for blended learning and adapting the state matura to the
							pandemic. The Union unites high-school students of all the ethnicities and faiths
							of North Macedonia in all regions of the country.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Union elected its new leadership on 29 May 2021 for a two-year term. The
							current administration persuaded the authorities to re-open the schools for
							both semester of the school year. It has also prepared 2 Draft Bills that will make
							public transport for all high-school students and regulate student councils for
							the first time in the country’s history. Since April 2022, the Union is a candidate-
							member of OBESSU.
