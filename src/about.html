										<h4>Luka Pavikjevikj</h4>
										<span>President</span>
										<p>
											I am a fourth-year student and a Boris Trajkovski Scholar at NOVA International Schools. Ever
											since my primary school days, I was frustrated by seeing the voice of the students twisted,
											ignored, or even shut down. There were no structures that adequately represented our voice, while
											the student councils served as a rubber stamp. This injustice motivated me to become a researcher
											and an activist. Apart from being a published author, co-editor-in-chief of my school’s newspaper,
											NOVA Times, and secretary of the student council, my career in the Union started in the spring of
											2020 as a member of the Executive Board and, then, Secretary-General. Elected in June 2021, I will
											use these two years as your President on creating a system that will properly represent us for
											years to come.

											My name is Jana Popova, I am a student in the Gymnasium Nikola Karev in Skopje. I am the First
											Vice President and International officer of the Union. I will give the best of myself to
											contribute towards implementing our goals in these two years that await us. I would say that I

											our voices heard. Therefore, my priority is to represent my peers and fight for a better education

										<h4>Emira Husovich</h4>
										<span>Advisor for International Curricula</span>
										<p>
											I am Emira Husovikj, the Advisor for International Curricula in the Union. Until September, 2022 I
											studied in the Gymnasium Koco Racin in Veles. However, last year I got a scholarship to study two
											years in one of the United World Colleges (UWC) in Tanzania. As an enthusiastic young student who
											wanted to make a change in the educational system, I joined the Union as an ambassador in the
											beginning of 2020. In 2022, I was appointed as the First - vice president of the Union. However,
											due to leaving Macedonia I became an Advisor for International Curricula. Beside being active in
											the Union, I have taken part in many NGOs like Ekvalis, Youth Can, Focus, Hera, Red Cross and
											UNICEF. Here in Tanzania, I am taking part in many committees in the school regarding
											sustainability, students’ rights, gender equality and anti-racism. I have been actively involved
											with the United Nations, as well as representing the students’ voice at the UN Pre-COP27 Youth
											Conference.

											I am Vlatko Stojkoski and I am a second year student in Yahya Kemal College in Skopje. With my

											education and the life of high-school students. They motivated me to join the Union. I like to
											speak and plan on different topics, and am very great with leadership positions especially when it
											gets to actually doing the work. All of soft and hard skills combined are what makes me a great
											great person to work with. I am a very sociable person and I am always ready to help.

										<h4>Eva Karamanovska</h4>
										<span>Head of Communications</span>
										<p>
											Hi, I am Eva Karamanovska, a third-year student in the Gymnasium Nikola Karev in Skopje. I am a
											young, very motivated individual with big ambitions and a great desire for work. I have been a
											member of student councils in both my primary and my high school, so the opportunity to be a part
											of the Union is an enormous opportunity both for personal development and for progress in
											education. I would call myself an artist that always uses her knowledge and talent for design to
											develop community projects. Ergo, my position in the Union is Head of Communications. I am a
											member of the graphic design team. I am also in charge of our social media profiles. I hope and
											believe that with lots of work and dedication, I will contribute to improving education in our
											country over these two years.

										<h4>Adora Limani</h4>
										<span>Head of Research and Strategy</span>
										<p>
											I am Adora Limani, and I attend NOVA International Schools. I am a third-year student. I have been
											a member of the Executive Board since 2020. Education activism and women's rights interest me
											particularly, so I founded the first feminist club in my school. My active participation in my
											school's debate club and newspaper, as well as my passion for writing, equipped me with research
											skills. That is why my current role in the Union is Head of Research and Strategy. My plan for the
											next two years is to use my skills and knowledge to help high-school students across the entire
											country fight for a better education.
