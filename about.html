										<h4>Luka Pavikjevikj</h4>
										<span>President</span>
										<p>
											I am a third-year student and a Boris Trajkovski Scholar at NOVA International Schools. Ever since
											my primary school days, I was frustrated by seeing the voice of the students twisted, ignored, or
											even shut down. There were no structures that adequately represented our voice, while the student
											councils served as a rubber stamp. This injustice motivated me to become a researcher and an
											activist. Apart from being a published author, co-editor-in-chief of my school’s newspaper, NOVA
											Times, and secretary of the student council, my career in the Union started in spring of 2020 as a
											member of the Executive Board and, then, Secretary-General. Elected in June 2021, I will use these
											two years as your President on creating a system that will properly represent us for years to
											come.

										<h4>Emira Husovich</h4>
										<span>First Vice President</span>
										<p>
											I am Emira Husovikj, the First Vice President of the Union. I go to the Kocho Ratsin Gymnasium in
											Veles. I am a third-year student. From 2020, I have been actively advocating for high-school
											students’ rights and fighting against the injustices in the education system. Apart from the
											Union, I am an active member of several NGOs, and I believe in anti-discrimination, sex education,
											activism, and volunteering. It can be said that those are my priorities. Yet, my biggest priority
											is forensics. After my secondary education, I want to study for a BA in Forensics and work in a
											crime lab.

											My name is Jana Popova, a third-year student in the Gymnasium Nikola Karev in Skopje. My position
											in the Union is Secretary-General. I will give the best of myself to contribute towards
											implementing our goals in these two years that await us. I would say that I have considerable

											Therefore, my priority is to represent my peers and fight for a better education system.

										<h4>Vlatko Stojkoski</h4>

										<p>
											I am Vlatko Stojkoski and I am a first-year student in the Yahya Kemal College in Skopje. With my
											ambitiousness and creativity, I managed to find inspiration to achieve the higher goals that I set
											for myself. Before becoming a member of the Union, I engaged in several projects via which I
											improved education and the life of high-school students. They motivated me to join the Union. My
											role in the Union reflects my most developed skills: programming, design, and social media.

										<h4>Eva Karamanovska</h4>

										<p>
											Hi, I am Eva Karamanovska, a third-year student in the Gymnasium Nikola Karev in Skopje. I am a
											young, very motivated individual with big ambitions and a great desire for work. I have been a
											member of student councils in both my primary and my high school, so the opportunity to be a part
											of the Union is an enormous opportunity both for personal development and for progress in
											education. I would call myself an artist that always uses her knowledge and talent for design to
											develop community projects. Ergo, my position in the Union is Head of Communications. I am a
											member of the graphic design team. I am also in charge of our social media profiles. I hope and
											believe that with lots of work and dedication, I will contribute to improving education in our
											country over these two years.

										<h4>Adora Limani</h4>
										<span>Head of Research and Strategy</span>
										<p>
											I am Adora Limani, and I attend NOVA International Schools. I am a third-year student. I have been
											a member of the Executive Board since 2020. Education activism and women's rights interest me
											particularly, so I founded the first feminist club in my school. My active participation in my
											school's debate club and newspaper, as well as my passion for writing, equipped me with research
											skills. That is why my current role in the Union is Head of Research and Strategy. My plan for the
											next two years is to use my skills and knowledge to help high-school students across the entire
											country fight for a better education.
